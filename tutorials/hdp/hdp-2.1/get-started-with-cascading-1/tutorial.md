This tutorial will enable you, as a Java developer, to learn the following:

*   Introduce you to [Hortonworks Data Platform 2.1](https://hortonworks.com/hdp) on [Hortonworks Sandbox](https://hortonworks.com/products/sandbox), a single-node cluster
*   Introduce you to Java Cascading SDK
*   Examine the WordCount program in Java
*   Build the single unit of execution, the jar file, using the gradle build tool
*   Deploy the jar file onto to the Sandbox
*   Examine the resulting MapReduce Jobs
*   View at the output stored as an HDSF file.

To start this tutorial, you must do two things: First, download the Sandbox and follow the installation instructions. Second, download the Cascading SDK.

The example WordCount is derived from part 2 of the Cascading [Impatient Series](http://docs.cascading.org/impatient/).

#### Downloading and installing the HDP 2.1 Sandbox

1.  [Download and install HDP 2.1 Sandbox](https://hortonworks.com/products/hortonworks-sandbox/#install).
2.  Familiarize yourself with the navigation on the Linux virtual host through a shell window.
3.  Login into your Linux Sandbox and create a user **cascade**. You can do this with the following command:


    useradd cascade


#### Git Clone Cascading example and Build it


First do `su cascade` to login as cascade user


1.  [Download and install gradle-1.1](http://www.gradle.org/downloads) onto the Linux sandbox.

    
    cd ~
    wget https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.9-bin.zip
    unzip gradle-1.9-bin.zip
    chmod +x gradle-1.9/bin/gradle
    
    
2.  Next,  `cd ~`
3.  `git clone git://github.com/Cascading/Impatient.git`
4.  `cd /home/cascade/Impatient/part2`
5.  `~/gradle-1.9/bin/gradle clean jar` (this builds the impatient.jar file, which is your wordcount unit of execution)

#### Deploying and running the Cascading Java application

Now you’re ready to run and deploy your impatient.jar file onto the cluster.


    cd /home/cascade/Impatient/part2
    hadoop fs -mkdir -p /user/cascade/data/
    hadoop fs -copyFromLocal data/rain.txt /user/cascade/data/
    hadoop jar ./build/libs/impatient.jar data/rain.txt output/wc


This command will produce the following output:

### Tracking the MapReduce Jobs on Sandbox

Once the job is submitted (or running) you can actually track its progress from the Sandbox MapReduce Job Browser. Click on **Job History UI**.

By default, it will display all jobs run by the user. Look for the latest one which should have a user **cascade**.

### Viewing the WordCount Output

When the job is finished, the word counts are written as an HDFS file **part-00000**. Use the Sandbox’s **HDFS Files** view to navigate to the HDFS directory and view its contents.

### Above and Beyond

For the adventurous, you can try the entire [Impatient Series](http://docs.cascading.org/impatient/), after you have downloaded the sources from the github. Beyond the Impatient series, there’re other [tutorials](http://www.cascading.org/documentation/tutorials/) and case examples to play with.

Have Fun!
